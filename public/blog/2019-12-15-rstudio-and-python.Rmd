In SDS 348, I have used RStudio to analyze a dataset that contained information about lung cancer patients who were veterans.

The last unit of the class explored Python, a commonly used programming language. I personally really like Python because it is very user friendly and allowed me to gain practical skills in the realm of programming. Python can do many things, including constructing plots and figures. For example, examine the figure below.

The first line of code is there in order to create a histogram plot of the dataset "eruptions". The second line of code adds a title to the graph, while the last line of code is there to actually get Python to display or print the plot. 

In the second second section, the first line of code is there in order to create a histogram plot of the dataset "waiting". The second line of code adds a title to the graph, while the last line of code is there to actually get Python to display or print the plot. 

Python is very versatile and is a great skill to have.
