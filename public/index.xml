      <description>In SDS 348, I have used RStudio to analyze a dataset that contained information about lung cancer patients who were veterans.
The last unit of the class explored Python, a commonly used programming language. I personally really like Python because it is very user friendly and allowed me to gain practical skills in the realm of programming. Python can do many things, including constructing plots and figures. For example, examine the figure below.</description>

      <description>Introduction I chose to work with these two datasets, veteran and cancer, since they are both related to lung cancer, which is a sector of medicine that interests me. The veteran dataset consists of randomized trial for veterans that explores two types of treatment for lung cancer. It contains variables such as cancer cell type, survival time, karno score (higher = better overall health), diagnosis time, age, and prior therapy.</description>
